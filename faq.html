		<h2>What is a 510 cartridge?</h2>
		<h>A 510 cartridge is a type of vaping product that works with almost any vape pen or battery. These cartridges are filled with THC oil and threaded with 510 threading, making them compatible with a variety of devices. A 510 cartridge allows you to enjoy the benefits of THC in an easy, convenient, and concealable way.</h>
		<h2>Do 510 cartridges expire?</h2>
		<h>Most 510 cartridges have an expiration date one year from the date of manufacture, however proper storage can extend their shelf life. It is important to keep your cartridges stored in a cool and dry place in order to get the most out of them. Although a cartridge may age it will only lead to THCa converting to CBN and causing a more indica-like effect.</h>
		<h2>What do I need to use a 510 cartridge?</h2>
		<h>To use a 510 cartridge, you need to have a compatible battery that has 510 threading. Luckily, we sell batteries that work amazingly well with our hardware, and you can buy them now for only $10!</h>
		<h2>Proper Inhalation Techniques</h2>
		<h>When it comes to inhalation, timing is crucial. To ensure optimal inhalation of your 510 cartridge, press and hold down the button on your battery while inhaling gently through the mouthpiece on the cartridge. Allow a half-second pause before commencing the inhale and release the button a second or two before completing the hit. Exhaling slowly and steadily is also important to clear the vapor from your lungs and avoid feeling overwhelmed. Proper inhalation and exhalation techniques help ensure that you get the full effect of the vapor without overdoing it, leading to a more enjoyable and satisfying vaping experience.</h>
