		<h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="product-description">Pink Champagne, also known more commonly as “Phantom” or “Raspberry Kush,” is an indica dominant hybrid (80% indica/20% sativa) strain created through crossing the infamous Ken's Granddaddy Purple X Cherry Pie strains. The bud packs a flavor just like the name suggests, packing tastes of sweet berries and grapes with a rich kush exhale. The aroma is of sweet grapes and berries with a notable fresh strawberry effect that's slightly spicy at times, almost like an actual glass of pink champagne. Its nugs have a slight pink tinge to them with rich purple undertones and a coating of clear crystal trichomes that look almost pink in the right light. The Pink Champagne high is both sedative and uplifting, perfect for kicking back when hanging out with friends at home or just on your own couch. The high starts with a euphoric mood boost that leaves you feeling giggly and relaxed. Your mind will swing back and forth between activity and grogginess as your body falls into couch-locked sedation. Thanks to these effects and its high 16-25% average THC level, Pink Champagne is said to be perfect for treating conditions such as migraines, chronic pain, insomnia, and depression.</p>
