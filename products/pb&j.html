		<h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="product-description">PB&J, also known as “PBJ,” is an evenly balanced hybrid strain (50% indica/50% sativa) created through crossing the delicious LA Confidential X Peanut Butter Kush strains. If you love a classic peanut butter and jelly sandwich, PB&J is perfect for you. This bud packs a sweet fruity flavor with hints of rich nutty peanut butter and a touch of spiciness to it, too. The aroma takes an earthy turn, with hints of sour fruits and spicy herbs accented by rich nutty pine. The PB&J high is one that's perfect for a lazy afternoon spent outdoors with the family or a long afternoon walk with the dog, bringing on uplifting and energizing effects that soon ebb away into happy relaxation. You'll feel creative with a sense of lifted focused energy that has you ready to get up and moving, although you won't be able to really focus on much of anything at all. These happy effects coupled with its super high 19-23% average THC level give PB&J an edge in treating conditions such as appetite loss or nausea, depression, chronic stress, mood swings and Bipolar Disorder. PB&J buds have long grape-shaped minty green nugs with thin orange hairs and a frosty thin coating of tiny bright white crystal trichomes.</p>
