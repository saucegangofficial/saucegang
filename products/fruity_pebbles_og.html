		<h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="product-description">Fruity Pebbles OG is an evenly balanced hybrid strain (50% indica/50% sativa) created through crossing the delicious (Grandaddy Purps X Green Ribbon) X Tahoe Alien strains. A classic bud with an amazing flavor, Fruity Pebbles OG is the perfect hybrid to add to your evening lineup. Like its namesake cereal, Fruity Pebbles OG packs a sweet and fruity flavor that's filled with sugary grapes, fresh berries and sour tropical citrus. The aroma is very much the same, with a super fruity and nutty smell that's accented by your favorite tropical citrus and fruits. The Fruity Pebbles OG high is just as delicious, with effects that will have you feeling aroused before helping you finally get to sleep. You'll be relaxed in both mind and body, filled with a lightly buzzy and pleasant weightiness that has you feeling creative yet kicked back. This buzz will soon turn heavy in your head, leaving you feeling pretty sedated and out of touch with reality. With these effects and its high 23-29% average THC level, Fruity Pebbles OG is often said to be perfect for treating a variety of conditions including chronic stress or anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain and depression. This bud has oversized and long grape-shaped emerald green nugs with minty undertones thin orange hairs and tiny, golden-white crystal trichomes.</p>
