		<h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="product-description">Birthday Cake Kush is an indica dominant hybrid strain that is created through a cross of the insanely delicious Girl Scout Cookies X Cherry Pie strains. Like it's name suggests, this bud has a crazy tasty flavor of fruity vanilla skunk with a hint of sweet nuttiness upon exhale. The smell is a little mellower, with a sweet skunky pungency that has a slightly vanilla overtone. These buds have a super frosty appearance, much like a birthday cake, with large and dense oversized heart-shaped light forest green nugs that have sparse fiery orange hairs. Although this bud is best loved for its flavor, the effects are just as enticing. The high starts with a happy and euphoric uplifted effect that launches your mood into the sky with a complete wiping of any mental pain or racing thoughts. As your mind soars with giddiness, your body will fall into a deeply relaxing and sedative state that immediately locks you to anything you're sitting on. You'll fall victim to a deeply sedated state that will eventually lull you into a deep and peaceful pain-free sleep. These effects and its powerful THC level of up to 24% make Birthday Cake Kush perfect for treating chronic pain, insomnia, headaches or migraines, muscle spasms, and inflammation.</p>
