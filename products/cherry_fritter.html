		<h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="product-description">Cherry Fritter is an evenly balanced hybrid strain (50% indica/50% sativa) created through crossing the classic Cherry Pie X Apple Fritter strains. A favorite for creating hash, Cherry Fritter is one delicious hybrid that will have you begging for dessert all day long. This bud tastes exactly like a sweet cherry fritter, with hints of rich cherries and sweet berries accented by a light doughiness. The aroma is very similar, although with an added touch of lightly sweet coffee, too. Cherry Fritter buds are beautiful, too, with long spade-shaped forest green nugs that are dotted with plenty of thin reddish amber hairs and a coating of super sticky resin. The Cherry Fritter high will hit you almost as soon as you exhale, lifting your spirits and infusing you with an almost tingly frenzied euphoria. A deep relaxation comes next, bringing your happiness down a notch or two and leaving you feeling kicked back and pretty sleepy. You won't fall asleep right away – rather, you'll be ravenously hungry first, snacking before you finally fade away. With these full-bodied effects and its high 17-27% average THC level, Cherry Fritter is often chosen to treat chronic stress, depression, chronic pain, insomnia and appetite loss or nausea.</p>
