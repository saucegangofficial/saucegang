		<h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="product-description">OG Kush, also known as “OGK,” is a slightly sativa dominant hybrid strain (55% sativa/45% indica) with unknown parentage due to breeder secrecy, although it is thought to be a cross of the iconic Chemdawg X Hindu Kush strains. Probably the most famous strain in the world of medicinal marijuana, OG Kush is the perfect hybrid for any indica or sativa lover. It starts almost as soon as you exhale, filling your brain with an uplifted sense of unfocused happiness and ease. You'll find yourself feeling sociable and outgoing, chatting with anyone and everyone around you, although you may fall in and out of fits of the giggles at times. A pang of hunger comes next, leaving you with a heavy case of the munchies and reaching for anything in sight to snack on. Combined with its high 20-26% average THC level, these effects make OG Kush a great choice for treating those suffering from conditions such as chronic stress or anxiety, mood swings or depression, appetite loss or nausea and migraines or headaches. This bud has a classic sour citrusy flavor with hints of woody pine. The aroma is very similar, with a spicy kushy overtone that's accented by sour citrus, woody pine and pungent dank. OG Kush buds have fat grape-shaped forest green nugs with long, thin orange hairs, golden undertones and a coating of tiny, golden-white crystal trichomes.</p>
