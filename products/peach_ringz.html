		<h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="product-description">Peach Ringz, also known as “Peach Rings,” is a slightly indica dominant hybrid strain (60% indica/40% sativa) created through crossing the delicious Marionberry X Eddy OG strains. With this bud, the name says it all in the flavor department. Peach Ringz packs a super sweet and slightly sour peachy flavor into each and every toke. The aroma is very similar, although with a touch of spicy flowers to it, too. A resin favorite, Peach Ringz brings on a super relaxing high that’s ideal for a night when you want to get to sleep but need to kick back and chill before you do. You’ll feel a light cerebral lift coupled with a mild euphoria that boosts your spirits without affecting your energy level in the slightest. A relaxing body high accompanies this state, lulling you further and further into physical sedation before finally allowing you to drift away into a deep and peaceful sleep. With these effects and its high 19-20% average THC level, Peach Ringz is often chosen to treat insomnia, muscle spasms or cramps, appetite loss or nausea, chronic pain and muscle spasms or cramps. This bud has spade-shaped minty green nugs with dark olive undertones, thin amber hairs and a frosty thick coating of tiny white crystal trichomes.</p>
