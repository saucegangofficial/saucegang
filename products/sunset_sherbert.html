		<h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="product-description">Sunset Sherbert, also known as “Gelato” and “Sunset Sherbet,” is an indica dominant hybrid (85% indica/15% sativa) strain created through crossing the delicious Pink Panties X Girl Scout Cookies strains. If you're a fan of sweet and fruity flavored cannabis, Sunset Sherbert is definitely made for you. This addictive bud has a fruity cookie flavor with a hint of minty cream and one of the smoothest exhales you'll ever experience. The aroma is slightly pungent with a sweet creamy overtone that's accented by fruits and a touch of sharp mint that will wake you up with one whiff. The Sunset Sherbert high is just as tasty as its flavors, with uplifted effects that are calming without weighing you down. The high begins with an almost immediate onset of an incredibly euphoric lift that instantly wipes away any negative thoughts and leaves you feeling happy. You might experience a slight increase in energy for a short while, but this typically fades very quickly into an overall sense of calm and awareness. These effects paired with its moderate 15-19% average THC level make Sunset Sherbert a great bud for all users who suffer from conditions such as chronic stress or anxiety, depression, and mood swings. This bud has oversized and super dense Christmas tree shaped minty green nugs with long orange hairs and milky white trichomes scattered across each leaf.</p>
