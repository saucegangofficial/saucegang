		<h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="product-description">Blueberry AK, not surprisingly, gets its name and its sativa-dominant genes from a cross of Blueberry and AK-47, both very popular and powerful strains in their own rights. But the precise ratio of sativa to indica is largely a mystery in Blueberry AK, as are the THC and CBD contents of this strain. Patient reviews suggest it's not terribly potent in either category, which means it's best used for its THC levels, even if they're not very high. It probably shouldn't be used to treat seizure disorders or other conditions that typically respond to CBD. The effects of this strain are cerebral and calming, with happiness and a case of the giggles. Blueberry AK can be used to relieve the symptoms of anxiety, depression, chronic pain, and everyday stress. It may also be useful in treating mood disorders, given its upbeat effects. This strain has a musky odor with berry notes and a fruity, Kush-like flavor. The buds are a medium green color with bright strands of amber throughout and a light layer of trichomes. There may be mild side effects, including dry eyes and dry mouth, but there are few public reports to verify this.</p>
